    " * A version control system for tracking changes in code\n",
    " * Coordinates work on source code with multiple programmers\n",

    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "git init\n",
    "```\n",
    "You need to specify which files are tracked. You can use the individual filenames, or \\*.py to track changes to all files. So decide which files to include, and use the following command to add them:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "git add [filename]\n",
    "```\n",
    "If you make small changes and want to back them up, use the git add command to 'update' the file. Once you make a major change and the code is in a state that you want to make a checkpoint, you'll want to 'commit' the change.\n",
    "\n",
    "To save them to the repository, use the following command (-a option means 'all' files, but you can also only commit one file by specifying the filename)\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "git commit -a\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "A text editor screen will appear, prompting you to add a message regarding what has been changed in the code. We'll discuss this more in the \"Style Guides\" section.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's it! You can now continue to make changes to the code, and when you're ready to save the current version of the project, use the 'commit' command. There are lots of good [cheat sheets](https://services.github.com/on-demand/downloads/github-git-cheat-sheet.pdf) available online.\n"
